# Cash Stash
Welcome to Cash Stash!

Cash Stash is an iOS app that helps you budget your money and keep track of your finances. With our app, you can analyze your income and expenses, add local transactions, and even fetch transactions from multiple banks using the ZenMoney REST API.

One of the key features of Cash Stash is the ability to create a diagram of your budget, which allows you to easily visualize where your money is going. Our app also makes use of modern gradient colors to make your budgeting experience as visually pleasing as possible.

Cash Stash is built with CoreData for saving local transactions and UserDefaults for storing categories. Additionally, we use the VIPER design pattern to ensure that the codebase is easy to understand and maintain.

We're proud to say that Cash Stash is open source and completely free to use. And as an bonus, we not use any third-party libraries, that make the app light and fast.

Thank you for choosing Cash Stash for your budgeting needs. We hope you find our app to be a valuable tool in managing your finances.
